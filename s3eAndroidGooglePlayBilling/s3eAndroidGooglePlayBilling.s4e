 *	Your callback needs to be of the form int32 MyCallback(void *systemData,void *userData)
 *  systemData is data from the store and needs to be cast to the appropriate structure - see the "systemdata points to" comments below.
 *	userData is specified when you register the callback, it is simply passed back to your callback and could be used to help the callback identify context (eg. it could be a pointer to a class you need to pass the data to)
 *  You register the callback using eg. s3eAndroidGooglePlayBillingRegister(S3E_ANDROIDGOOGLEPLAYBILLING_PURCHASE_CALLBACK, myPurchaseCallback, this);
 *	The return value is always ignored.
